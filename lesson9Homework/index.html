            <h2>Etymology</h2>
          <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. </p>
          <p>Do images truly express as much as words do - or even more? Why do some pictures evoke strong emotions within us or strike a chord deep within? You may or may not have answers to such questions. But what you have here is a well-curated list of words of wisdom or witty one-liners from photographers who have wowed us with their stellar images. This is a collection of famous photography quotes on their observations about their art, passion, and profession.</p>

                <li>“A thing that you see in my pictures is that I was not afraid to fall in love with these people.”
                </li>
                <li>“Great photography is about depth of feeling, not depth of field.”
                </li>
                <li>“It is more important to click with people than to click the shutter.”</li>
                <li>“Taking pictures is like tiptoeing into the kitchen late at night and stealing Oreo cookies.”
                </li>
                <li>“If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.”

                    What Is_?</h2>
                <p>The word Photography literally means ‘drawing with light’, which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.</p>

    <h2>Why We Do It: Photographers and Photo Editors on the Passion That Drives Their Work</h2>
    <p>he people who make up today’s thriving photographic community are our eyes to the world. Whether established artists and journalists or passionate emerging voices, they inform us, they inspire us, they amaze us, they put our world in the broader context of history.

        But that community also faces great challenges — dwindling sales, increased competition and a fragile trust in photographers’ mission to inform. Too often, those factors can make those of us in that community, photographers and photo editors alike, lose sight of what drive us.</p>
        <p>Photographs are the universal language of our era. Everyone has hundreds, maybe thousands in their pocket. Weightless, they turn the scale when the argument is: What happened here? Images don’t age or warp. A great photographer’s strings never go out of tune.</p>
        <p>It is for this reason that we need photographers. They are the ones who sort all the chaos of the world into images that bring clarity to the free-for-all of life. They are the witnesses and artists who can distill the mayhem and beauty that surrounds us. They call our attention to the things we miss in our everyday lives and they call our attention to events and people at a great distance from our own patch of the universe. When they direct our eyes and hearts with precision and honesty, we know what we know differently and better. Photographers teach us to look again, look harder. Look through their eyes.</p>
