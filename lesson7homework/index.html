                <h4>Oppenheimer</h4>
            <p>A dramatization of the life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb, thus helping end World War 2. We see his life from university days all the way to post-WW2, where his fame saw him embroiled in political machinations.In order for the black and white sections of the movie to be shot in the same quality as the rest of the film, Kodak produced a limited supply of their Double-X black and white film stock in 70mm. This film stock was chosen specifically for its heritage - it was originally sold to photographers as Super-XX during World War II, and was very popular with photojournalists of the era.</p>

            <h4>Napoleon</h4>
            <p>Napoleon is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, played by Oscar®-winner Joaquin Phoenix. Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte's relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Josephine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.</p>

                <p>The story takes place in the 1920s around the Osage Indian tribe living in the American city of Oklahoma. Native Americans are being killed one by one after one of them becomes rich by discovering oil. The Osage massacre attracts the attention of the FBI, and it begins an investigation.The investigation into Osage County was the first investigation presented to the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It was led by J. Edgar Hoover.Greed and the Problem of American Ideals

                    But, as Killers of the Flower Moon makes clear, these valued qualities were not inalienable and gave rise to a murderous sense of individual entitlement and toxic greed.Greed and the Problem of American Ideals

                <h4>The Killer</h4>
                <p>A man solitary and cold, methodical and unencumbered by scruples or regrets, the killer waits in the shadows, watching for his next target. And yet the longer he waits, the more he thinks he's losing his mind, if not his cool. A brutal, bloody and stylish noir story of a professional assassin lost in a world without a moral compass, this is a case study of a man alone, armed to the teeth and slowly losing his mind.In 2008 Fincher originally thought of Brad Pitt for the role of The Killer but Pitt said it was a little too "nihilistic" for him.
